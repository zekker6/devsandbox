## Coding practices

After completing the task always run:

- `task test` - to run tests

## Tools to use

Tools management: mise
Create .mise.toml with all tools to be used and pin the dependencies.

Use `task` for setting up automation: create a taskfile which will cover build, lint, test, running the appliication.

CI: repository will be hosted at gitea. Update it to correlate with current project when needed.

Linters: golangci + go default linters.
